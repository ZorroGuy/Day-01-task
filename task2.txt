Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

1. **Objects in JavaScript**:
   - Core data structure comprising key-value pairs.
   - Dynamic nature allows for flexible manipulation of properties.

2. **Internal Representation**:
   - Utilizes hash tables for efficient storage and retrieval of properties.
   - Assigns hidden classes to objects to optimize property access.

3. **Hash Tables**:
   - Employed by JavaScript engines for fast property lookup.
   - Keys are hashed to determine storage index for values.

4. **Hidden Classes**:
   - Assigned to objects to define structure and behavior.
   - Objects with similar structures share the same hidden class for optimization.

5. **Inline Caching**:
   - Technique to optimize property accesses and method calls.
   - Caches accessed properties/methods for quicker future accesses.

6. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - Hash tables enable rapid property manipulation and retrieval.
   - Hidden classes and inline caching enhance performance by streamlining property access.

7. **Impact on Performance**:
   - Understanding object representation aids in writing efficient code.
   - Optimization techniques contribute to faster execution and improved performance.

8. **Developers' Role**:
   - Developers can leverage knowledge of internal representation for better code optimization.
   - Efficient object handling leads to more scalable and performant applications.

9. **Continued Evolution**:
   - JavaScript's object representation evolves alongside language advancements.
   - Developers should stay updated to leverage new optimization opportunities.

10. **Practical Application**:
    - Mastery of object representation enhances developers' ability to write optimized code.
    - Efficient code contributes to faster web applications and improved user experience.
